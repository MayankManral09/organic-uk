          To keep the Ganga free of toxic chemicals, the Uttarakhand government
          is executing a centrally funded scheme, under which hill farmers in
          the catchment area of the river are being encouraged to adopt organic
          farming. The scheme would also help augment their income
          substantially, officials said.

          “Under the first phase of the centrally funded project, all poor and
          marginal hill farmers inhabiting the 42 villages in the catchment area
          of the river Ganga are being given full support to adopt organic
          farming”, said Gauri Shankar, director, agriculture referring to
          Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY). The scheme is being
          implemented under the aegis of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet
          project, Namami Gange or National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).

          “The initiative to encourage farmers to go for organic farming came
          from the Centre”, he said adding that it (Centre) approved 42 villages
          out of a list of 139 (villages) in the catchment area of the Ganga,
          which was forwarded by the state government.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The 42 villages (in the catchment of the Ganga) selected for
          promoting organic farming fall in five districts”, Shankar said
          referring to Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Pauri, Rudraprayag and Tehri.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the plan, farmers will be encouraged to create clusters of
          different organic crops like millets, pulses, kidney beans apart from
          vegetables like Amaranthus etc. “The emphasis is on cluster based
          farming because if a crop is grown in clusters its volume goes up,
          which will fetch hill farmers good price”, said the official.

        <p>
          “Such mode of farming could be remunerative in the hills where farm
          produce fetches farmers hardly any income”, Shankar said. He
          attributed the invariably low farm yield hill farmers get owing to
          different types of crops they grow in their small, terraced
          agricultural holdings.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Volumes of crops are high when grown in clusters, which will also
          fetch small and marginal hill farmers good price as the agricultural
          produce can be marketed in bulk”, Shankar said. According to him, a
          cluster each spread over a 20-hectare area each would be created in
          all the 42 villages selected under PKVY. Organic crops to be grown in
          clusters would be far more remunerative owing to their increased
          demand among the health conscious consumers, the official clarified.
