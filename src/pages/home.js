        <p>
          Uttarakhand also known as Uttaranchal is a state in the northern part
          of India. It is often referred to as the "Devbhumi” due to its
          religious significance and numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage
          centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is known for the
          natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai
          regions. The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon,
          with a total of 13 districts. The winter capital of Uttarakhand is
          Dehradun, the largest city of the state, which is a rail head.
          Bhararisain, a town in Chamoli district, is the summer capital of
          Uttarakhand. The High Court of the state is located in Nainital.

          Uttarakhand has a total area of 53,566 km2 (20,682 sq mi), of which
          86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forest. Most of the northern
          part of the state is covered by high Himalayan peaks and glaciers. In
          the first half of the nineteenth century, the expanding development of
          Indian roads, railways and other physical infrastructure was giving
          rise to concerns over indiscriminate logging, particularly in the
          Himalaya. Two of the most important rivers in Hinduism originate in
          the glaciers of Uttarakhand, the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at
          Yamunotri. They are fed by myriad lakes, glacial melts and streams.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Uttarakhand lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range, and the
          climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from glaciers at
          the highest elevations to subtropical forests at the lower elevations.
          The highest elevations are covered by ice and bare rock. Below them,
          between 3,000 and 5,000 metres (9,800 and 16,400 ft) are the western
          Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. The temperate western Himalayan
          subalpine conifer forests grow just below the tree line. At 3,000 to
          2,600 metres (9,800 to 8,500 ft) elevation they transition to the
          temperate western Himalayan broadleaf forests, which lie in a belt
          from 2,600 to 1,500 metres (8,500 to 4,900 ft) elevation. Below 1,500
          metres (4,900 ft) elevation lie the Himalayan subtropical pine
          forests. The Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests and the
          drier Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands cover the lowlands along the
          Uttar Pradesh border in a belt locally known as Bhabar. These lowland
          forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture, but a few pockets
          remain.

        <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Organic Farming</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Organic farming is a method of crop and livestock production that
          involves much more than choosing not to use pesticide, fertilizer,
          genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Organic farming promotes the use of crop rotations and cover crops and
          encourages balanced host/predator relationships. Organic residues and
          nutrient produced on the farm are recycled back to the soil. Cover
          crops and composted manure are used to maintain soil organic matter
          and fertility.

        <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Why Organic Farming</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          India is majorly into the development of agriculture and the
          environment. Organic farming concludes both of them together. In
          organic farming, there is a use of bio products which is safe for the
          soil as well as the environment so both the objectives are achieved.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So organic farming is supported by the government as well in all
          aspects. In the economic development sector also plays a very
          important role.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There is a very big difference between conventional farming and
          organic farming concerning sales. The products produced from
          conventional farming are very cheap and low quality versus the
          products produced from organic farming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The agricultural sector owes a very important part in enhancing the
          export value of India. The food products that were exported earlier
          did not gain many profits and were also not healthy affecting people
          with different diseases, but due to organic farming, the cost of
          production is less due to reduction in using the toxic substance and
          the profits are more which leads to good health and also affects the
          government’s export value.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Organic farming which is a holistic production management system that
          promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity,
          biological cycles, and soil biological activity is hence important.
          Many studies have shown that organic farming methods can produce even
          higher yields than conventional methods. Significant difference in
          soil health indicators such as nitrogen mineralization potential and
          microbial abundance and diversity, which were higher in the organic
          farms can also be seen. The increased soil health in organic farms
          also resulted in considerably lower insect and disease incidence. The
          emphasis on small-scale integrated farming systems has the potential
          to revitalize rural areas and their economies.

          Reasons to choose Organic Farming
        </h2>
        <br />

        <h4 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
          It boosts the nutritional quality of food
        </h4>
        <p>
          Organic crops are grown in biologically healthy and safe active soils.
          Crops on organic farms take a longer time to grow and tend to yield
          less per acre than crops on industrial agriculture. Also, plants
          nourished by soil on organic farms produce crops that are most likely
          to consist of more important minerals, antioxidants, and vitamins.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
          Organic food gives the best results for health issues
        </h4>
        <p>
          There are so many problems everyone is facing in the conventional food
          system like learning disabilities, water pollution, birth defects,
          farm animals suffering and so much more. The certified organic label
          stands in giving what people need in today’s generation that includes
          nutritious food, good water quality, products grown naturally without
          using toxins, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
          Decreases the intake of antibiotics and unnecessary hormones
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most of the conventional farmers use a lot of mixture of growth
          hormones, supplements, drugs, and toxic substances so that their
          animals grow products faster, bigger and produce more milk compare to
          their natural products and give more per day than these products
          consumed by us leads to heavy intake of antibiotics. By growing
          products organically will help reduce the intake of all these. The
          National Organic Program rule prohibits virtually synthetic animal
          drug use therefore in the end healthy animals produce healthy milk,
          meat, dairy products, eggs, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Maintenance for healthy soil</h4>
        <p>
          Having healthy soil is the main thing for all successful organic
          farms. After all the comparison done by so many studies over the past
          years, it is concluded that the soil quality of conventional farms is
          affecting the soil health versus the organic farms that practice
          organic management which includes enhancing the soil quality, crop
          rotation, restore organic components, and nitrogen to help fight
          global warming.

        <h4 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
          Create a healthy environment in the workplace and neighboring areas
        </h4>
        <p>
          Farming is the second most hazardous occupation in the list of mining.
          Until and unless good care is practiced, caustic fertilizers, toxic
          pesticides, and so many other chemicals pose a risk to a lot of people
          living or working near the farms. By going organic, the use of
          high-risk chemical products by the farmers is very less so the workers
          and rural Neighbors have nothing to worry about their health.
