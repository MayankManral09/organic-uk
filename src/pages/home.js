          Organic farming is a production system which avoids or largely
          excludes the use of synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides,
          growth regulators, genetically modified organisms and livestock food
          additives. To the maximum extent possible organic farming system rely
          upon crop rotations, use of crop residues, animal manures, legumes,
          green manures, off farm organic wastes, biofertilizers, mechanical
          cultivation, mineral bearing rocks and aspects of biological control
          to maintain soil productivity and tilth to supply plant nutrients and
          to control insect, weeds and other pests.

          Organic methods can increase farm productivity, repair decades of
          environmental damage and knit small farm families into more
          sustainable distribution networks leading to improved food security if
          they organize themselves in production, certification and marketing.
          During last few years an increasing number of farmers have shown lack
          of interest in farming and the people who used to cultivate are
          migrating to other areas. Organic farming is one way to promote either
          self-sufficiency or food security. Use of massive inputs of chemical
          fertilizers and toxic pesticides poisons the land and water heavily.
          The after-effects of this are severe environmental consequences,
          including loss of topsoil, decrease in soil fertility, surface and
          ground water contamination and loss of genetic diversity.

          Organic farming which is a holistic production management system that
          promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity,
          biological cycles, and soil biological activity is hence important.
          Many studies have shown that organic farming methods can produce even
          higher yields than conventional methods. Significant difference in
          soil health indicators such as nitrogen mineralization potential and
          microbial abundance and diversity, which were higher in the organic
          farms can also be seen. The increased soil health in organic farms
          also resulted in considerably lower insect and disease incidence. The
          emphasis on small-scale integrated farming systems has the potential
          to revitalize rural areas and their economies.

          <li>
            It helps to maintain environment health by reducing the level of
            pollution.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It reduces human and animal health hazards by reducing the level of
            residues in the product.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It helps in keeping agricultural production at a sustainable level.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It reduces the cost of agricultural production and also improves the
            soil health.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It ensures optimum utilization of natural resources for short-term
            benefit and helps in conserving them for future generation.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It not only saves energy for both animal and machine, but also
            reduces risk of crop failure.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It improves the soil physical properties such as granulation, good
            tilth, good aeration, easy root penetration and improves
            water-holding capacity and reduces erosion.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            It improves the soilâ€™s chemical properties such as supply and
            retention of soil nutrients, reduces nutrient loss into water bodies
            and environment and promotes favourable chemical reactions.
