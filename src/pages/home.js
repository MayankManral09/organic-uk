        <p>
          Uttarakhand also known as Uttaranchal is a state in the northern part
          of India. It is often referred to as the "Devbhumi” due to its
          religious significance and numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage
          centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is known for the
          natural environment of the Himalayas, the Bhabar and the Terai
          regions. The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon,
          with a total of 13 districts. The winter capital of Uttarakhand is
          Dehradun, the largest city of the state, which is a rail head.
          Bhararisain, a town in Chamoli district, is the summer capital of
          Uttarakhand. The High Court of the state is located in Nainital.

          Uttarakhand has a total area of 53,566 km2 (20,682 sq mi), of which
          86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forest. Most of the northern
          part of the state is covered by high Himalayan peaks and glaciers. In
          the first half of the nineteenth century, the expanding development of
          Indian roads, railways and other physical infrastructure was giving
          rise to concerns over indiscriminate logging, particularly in the
          Himalaya. Two of the most important rivers in Hinduism originate in
          the glaciers of Uttarakhand, the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at
          Yamunotri. They are fed by myriad lakes, glacial melts and streams.

          Uttarakhand lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range, and the
          climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from glaciers at
          the highest elevations to subtropical forests at the lower elevations.
          The highest elevations are covered by ice and bare rock. Below them,
          between 3,000 and 5,000 metres (9,800 and 16,400 ft) are the western
          Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. The temperate western Himalayan
          subalpine conifer forests grow just below the tree line. At 3,000 to
          2,600 metres (9,800 to 8,500 ft) elevation they transition to the
          temperate western Himalayan broadleaf forests, which lie in a belt
          from 2,600 to 1,500 metres (8,500 to 4,900 ft) elevation. Below 1,500
          metres (4,900 ft) elevation lie the Himalayan subtropical pine
          forests. The Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests and the
          drier Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands cover the lowlands along the
          Uttar Pradesh border in a belt locally known as Bhabar. These lowland
          forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture, but a few pockets
          remain.

        <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Organic Farming</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Organic farming is a production system which avoids or largely
          excludes the use of synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides,
          growth regulators, genetically modified organisms and livestock food
          additives. To the maximum extent possible organic farming system rely
          upon crop rotations, use of crop residues, animal manures, legumes,
          green manures, off farm organic wastes, biofertilizers, mechanical
          cultivation, mineral bearing rocks and aspects of biological control
          to maintain soil productivity and tilth to supply plant nutrients and
          to control insect, weeds and other pests.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Organic methods can increase farm productivity, repair decades of
          environmental damage and knit small farm families into more
          sustainable distribution networks leading to improved food security if
          they organize themselves in production, certification and marketing.
          During last few years an increasing number of farmers have shown lack
          of interest in farming and the people who used to cultivate are
          migrating to other areas. Organic farming is one way to promote either
          self-sufficiency or food security. Use of massive inputs of chemical
          fertilizers and toxic pesticides poisons the land and water heavily.
          The after-effects of this are severe environmental consequences,
          including loss of topsoil, decrease in soil fertility, surface and
          ground water contamination and loss of genetic diversity.

          Organic farming which is a holistic production management system that
          promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity,
          biological cycles, and soil biological activity is hence important.
          Many studies have shown that organic farming methods can produce even
          higher yields than conventional methods. Significant difference in
          soil health indicators such as nitrogen mineralization potential and
          microbial abundance and diversity, which were higher in the organic
          farms can also be seen. The increased soil health in organic farms
          also resulted in considerably lower insect and disease incidence. The
          emphasis on small-scale integrated farming systems has the potential
          to revitalize rural areas and their economies.
