    "content": "After oil is extracted from oilseeds the remaining solid portion is dried as cake which can be used as manure. The oil cakes are of two types - Edible oil cakes which can be safely fed to livestock- e.g.- Groundnut cake Coconut cake etc. and Non edible oil cakes which are not fit for feeding livestock- e.g.- Castor cake Neem cake Mahua cake etc. Both edible and non-edible oil cakes can be used as manures. However edible oil cakes are fed to cattle and non-edible oil cakes are used as manures especially for horticultural crops. Nutrients present in oil cakes after mineralization are made available to crops 7 to 10 days after application. Oilcakes need to be well powdered before application for even distribution and quicker decomposition."

    "title": "Green Manures",
    "content": "Green manures are crops grown specifically for building and maintaining soil fertility and structure though they may also have other functions. They are normally incorporated back into the soil either directly or after removal and composting. Green manures are crops grown within a rotation for the purposes of- building soil organic matter and soil structure supplying nitrogen and other nutrients for a following crop preventing leaching of soluble nutrients from the soil providing ground cover to prevent damage to soil structure bringing crop nutrients up from lower soil profiles smothering weeds and preventing weed seedling growth. Types of green manure crop - Green manures are essentially of two types- Legumes develop on their roots (in association with special bacteria) nodules that have the ability to take nitrogen from the air and convert (fix) it into a form that the plant can use. This can then be utilised by crops grown after the legume has been ploughed and incorporated into the soil. Non-legumes Non-legumes do not fix nitrogen but can provide useful amounts of organic matter and retain nutrients that might otherwise be leached. Some non-legume green manures are very quick growing and can be incorporated within gaps in production during the growing season.\u00c2\u00a0"

    "content": "Concentrated organic manure- These manures are organic in nature and contain large amounts of plant nutrients like Nitrogen Phosphorus oxide and Potassium oxide. Concentrated organic manures are made from raw materials obtained from animals and plants e.g. oil cakes blood meal and fish manure meat etc which contains iron calcium nitrogen and phosphorus. Characteristics features of concentrated organic manure- Water holding capacity is increased by organic manures. Organic manures help to reduce the alkalinity in soils. Fresh organic manures are a source of food for earthworms ants and rodents. These organisms improve drainage and aeration."

    "content": "Compost crumbly mass of rotted organic matter made from decomposed\u00c2\u00a0plant\u00c2\u00a0material used in\u00c2\u00a0gardening\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0agriculture. Compost is especially important in\u00c2\u00a0organic farming where the use of\u00c2\u00a0synthetic\u00c2\u00a0fertilizers\u00c2\u00a0is not permitted. Compost improves soil structure provides a wide range of nutrients for plants and adds\u00c2\u00a0beneficial\u00c2\u00a0microbes to the\u00c2\u00a0soil. Composts commonly contain about 2 percent\u00c2\u00a0nitrogen 0.5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 percent\u00c2\u00a0phosphorus and about 2 percent\u00c2\u00a0potassium. Nitrogen\u00c2\u00a0fertilizers\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0manure\u00c2\u00a0may be added to speed decomposition. The nitrogen of compost becomes available slowly and in small amounts which reduces leaching and extends availability over the whole\u00c2\u00a0growing season. Because of their fairly low nutrient content composts are usually applied in large amounts. Compost can be prepared on a small scale for home gardens usually in a simple pile of yard waste and kitchen scraps though compost bins and barrels are also used. Aeration is important for proper decomposition so piles are usually mixed every few days. When properly prepared compost is free of\u00c2\u00a0obnoxious\u00c2\u00a0odours. A compost pile with the right ratio of carbon to nitrogen (30-1) and with adequate moisture will produce enough heat during decomposition to kill many pathogens and seeds though it is advisable to avoid adding diseased plant matter and\u00c2\u00a0weeds\u00c2\u00a0that have gone to\u00c2\u00a0seed.\u00c2\u00a0"

The present method of preparing farmyard manure by the farmers is defective. The manure becomes ready for use in about four to five months after plastering. If urine is not collected in the bedding it can be collected along with washings of the cattle shed in a cemented pit from which it is later added to the farmyard manure pit. Vegetable crops like potato tomato sweet-potato carrot raddish onion etc. respond well to the farmyard manure. The other responsive crops are sugarcane rice napier grass and orchard crops like oranges banana mango and plantation crop like coconut."

On an average the manure contains 3 per cent N 1 per cent P2O5 and 2 per cent K2O.It is applied to the field in two ways. The sweeping of sheep or goat sheds are placed in pits for decomposition and it is applied later to the field. The nutrients present in the urine are\u00c2\u00a0wasted\u00c2\u00a0in this method. The second method is sheep penning wherein sheep and goats are kept overnight in the field and urine and fecal matter added to the soil is incorporated to a shallow depth by working blade harrow or cultivator or cultivator."

Composted chicken manure\u00c2\u00a0provides a slow-release source of macro- and micronutrients and acts as a soil amendment. Compared to other manures chicken manure and the associated litter are higher in nitrogen potassium phosphorus and calcium and are also rich in organic matter."
